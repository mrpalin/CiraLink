# CiraLink AI Assistant Widget (Secure Version)

CiraLink is a complete, production-ready AI assistant widget that can be embedded on any website. This version has been refactored to use a **secure serverless proxy**, ensuring your API keys are never exposed to the client-side.

It is fully static (plus one serverless function), easily deployable on Netlify, and supports license-based feature control through the LemonSqueezy API.

## Key Features

-   **Secure API Proxy**: All communication with external services (OpenAI, LemonSqueezy) is routed through a serverless function, protecting your secret API keys.
-   **Domain-Locked Licenses**: Each license key is automatically locked to the domain it is first used on, preventing unauthorized use on other websites.
-   **Custom Personalities & Knowledge**: Define a custom personality and provide a specific knowledge base for the AI on `pro` and `business` plans.
-   **Floating Widget**: A clean, floating microphone/chat icon on the bottom-right of the host website.
-   **Text & Voice**: Supports text-based conversation and optional voice interaction via the Web Speech API.
-   **AI-Powered**: Integrates with the OpenAI GPT-3.5 API for intelligent responses.
-   **License-Controlled**: Features are enabled based on a validated LemonSqueezy license key (`text`, `pro`, or `business` plans).
-   **Customizable & Deployable**: Easily configure and deploy on Netlify.

## Setup Guide

(Setup instructions remain the same as the previous version: Get API keys, deploy to Netlify, and configure environment variables.)

## Embedding and Customization

Once deployed, use the public URL provided by Netlify. Paste the snippet just before the closing `</body>` tag on your site.
